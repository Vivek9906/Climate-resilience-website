Use household products and materials with low VOC emissions, and keep indoor plants that can help purify the air.

Examine walls, floors, doors, staircases, and windows to make sure that the building is not in danger of collapsing. Inspect foundations for cracks or other damage.

Check for gas leaks.If you smell gas or hear a blowing or hissing noise, open a window and get everyone outside quickly. Turn off the gas using the outside main valve if you can, and call the gas company from a neighbour’s home. If you turn off the gas for any reason, it must be turned back on by a professional.</li>

If you see sparks or broken or frayed wires, or if you smell burning insulation, turn off the electricity at the main fuse box or circuit breaker. If you have to step in water to get to the fuse box or circuit breaker, call an electrician first for advice. Electrical equipment should be checked and dried before being returned to service.</li>

You can obtain safe water from undamaged water heaters or by melting ice cubes that were made before the tsunami hit. Turn off the main water valve before draining water from these sources. Use tap water only if local health officials advise it is safe.</li>

However, the general region where hail can be expected is very predictable. Hail occurs in association with thunderstorms, particularly supercell thunderstorms.

CAPES under 1000 J/kg generally produce borderline severe hail (near 3/4" or less) while CAPES over 2000 J/kg can produce very large hailstones.

Strong upper level winds tilt the updraft of developing thunderstorms. This allows the updraft and downdraft to be separated from each other. This produces higher UVV's in the updraft.

High moisture soundings result in water loading. CAPE is reduced with water loading since the force of gravity pushes down on the liquid water drops.

    <p>Here you can find information about pollution levels in West Bengal.</p>
    <h2>Cause of Pollution:</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Industrial Emissions:</b> West Bengal's industrial hubs, including areas like Kolkata, Howrah, and Haldia, contribute to air pollution through emissions of particulate matter, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
      <br>
      <b>Vehicle Emissions:</b> Increasing vehicular traffic in cities like Kolkata and Siliguri leads to emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter, contributing to air pollution.
      <br>
      <b>Agricultural Activities:</b> Burning of crop residues and use of fertilizers contribute to air pollution in rural areas of West Bengal.
      <br>
      <b>Construction Activities:</b> Construction sites in urban and suburban areas generate dust and particulate matter, adding to air pollution levels.
      <br>
      <b>Waste Burning:</b> Open burning of waste, including plastic and biomass, releases harmful pollutants into the air, especially in densely populated areas.
    </p>
    <h2>Current Pollution Levels</h2>

    </table>
    <p>As of now, the air pollution condition in West Bengal is moderate. Major cities like Kolkata and Siliguri may experience higher pollution levels, especially during peak traffic hours and winter months.</p>
    <h2>Future Outlook</h2>
    <p>
      <i>Improving air quality in West Bengal requires concerted efforts and strategic interventions. Here are some steps that can be taken:</i><br>
      <br>
      <b>Promote Clean Energy:</b> Encourage the adoption of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
      <br>
      <b>Enhance Public Transportation:</b> Improve public transportation infrastructure and promote the use of electric vehicles to reduce emissions from transportation.
      <br>
      <b>Strengthen Industrial Regulations:</b> Enforce strict emission standards for industries and promote cleaner production techniques.
      <br>
      <b>Waste Management:</b> Implement effective waste management practices, including recycling and proper disposal, to reduce open burning of waste.
      <br>
      <b>Awareness Campaigns:</b> Conduct public awareness campaigns to educate citizens about the importance of air quality and encourage sustainable practices.

    <h1>Manipur Pollution Information</h1>

    <p>Here you can find information about pollution levels in Manipur.</p>
    <h2>Cause of Pollution:</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Industrial Pollution:</b> While Manipur's industrial sector is relatively small, emissions from industries, such as brick kilns and small-scale manufacturing units, contribute to air pollution.
      <br>
      <b>Vehicle Emissions:</b> The growing number of vehicles, particularly in urban areas like Imphal, leads to emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter, contributing to air pollution.
      <br>
      <b>Biomass Burning:</b> Traditional practices such as burning of agricultural waste and wood for cooking and heating purposes contribute to localized air pollution in rural areas.
    </p>
    <h2>Current Pollution Levels</h2>

    <p>The air pollution condition in Manipur is relatively moderate compared to other states, but efforts are being made to address sources of pollution and improve air quality.</p>
    <h2>Future Outlook</h2>
    <p>
      <i>To improve air quality in Manipur, various measures are being considered:</i><br>
      <br>
      <b>Promote Clean Energy:</b> Encourage the adoption of cleaner cooking technologies and renewable energy sources to reduce reliance on biomass burning.
      <br>
      <b>Enhance Public Transport:</b> Improve public transportation systems and promote the use of electric vehicles to reduce vehicular emissions.
      <br>
      <b>Community Awareness:</b> Raise awareness among communities about the health impacts of air pollution and promote sustainable practices.
      <br>
      <b>Regulatory Measures:</b> Enforce regulations to control emissions from industries and vehicles, and promote eco-friendly practices.

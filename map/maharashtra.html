    <h1>Maharashtra Pollution Information</h1>
    <img src="https://example.com/maharashtra-pollution.jpg" alt="Maharashtra Pollution">
    <p>Here you can find information about pollution levels in Maharashtra.</p>
    <h2>Cause of Pollution:</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Industrial Pollution:</b> Maharashtra's industrial hubs, such as Mumbai, Pune, and Nagpur, contribute to air pollution through emissions of particulate matter, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
      <br>
      <b>Vehicle Emissions:</b> The high density of vehicles in cities like Mumbai and Pune results in emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter, contributing to air pollution.
      <br>
      <b>Construction Activities:</b> Urban development and infrastructure projects lead to dust and particulate matter emissions, especially during construction activities, contributing to air pollution.
    </p>
    <h2>Current Pollution Levels</h2>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Date</th>
        <th>AQI PM2.5</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>

    </table>
    <p>The air pollution condition in Maharashtra varies across regions, with urban areas experiencing higher pollution levels due to industrial activities, vehicular emissions, and construction. Efforts are underway to mitigate these sources of pollution and improve air quality.</p>
    <h2>Future Outlook</h2>
    <p>
      <i>To improve air quality in Maharashtra, various measures are being considered:</i><br>
      <br>
      <b>Promote Clean Energy:</b> Encourage the adoption of renewable energy sources and promote energy efficiency to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
      <br>
      <b>Enhance Public Transport:</b> Expand public transportation networks, promote electric vehicles, and improve infrastructure to reduce vehicular emissions.
      <br>
      <b>Strengthen Regulations:</b> Enforce stricter emission standards for industries and vehicles, and implement measures to control dust from construction activities.
      <br>
      <b>Urban Planning:</b> Incorporate green spaces, sustainable building practices, and urban forestry into city planning to mitigate pollution.
      <br>
      <b>Public Awareness:</b> Raise awareness about the health impacts of air pollution and encourage community participation in pollution reduction efforts.
